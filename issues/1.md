### Feature Request: Automate Version Management and Improve GitHub Workflow Best Practices

#### Description
To enhance the deployment process and align with industry best practices, it is recommended to improve the current GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) by automating version management and adding several enhancements. These improvements will ensure more reliable, maintainable, and automated deployments.

#### Proposed Enhancements
1. **Automate Version Management**:
   - Automatically bump the version in `package.json` during deployments using tools like `npm version` or `semantic-release`.
   - Ensure that version changes are committed and tagged in GitHub.
   
2. **Add Build Validation**:
   - Introduce a `Run Tests` step to validate the build before deployment. This can prevent faulty deployments and improve stability.
   - Example command: `npm test`.
   
3. **Optimize Dependency Caching**:
   - Use a more robust caching strategy for Node.js dependencies by utilizing the checksum of `package-lock.json`.
   - Example with `actions/cache`:
     ```yaml
     - name: Cache Node Modules
       uses: actions/cache@v3
       with:
         path: ~/.npm
         key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
         restore-keys: |
           ${{ runner.os }}-node-
     ```

4. **Embed Version in Build**:
   - Extract the version from `package.json` using `jq` and make it accessible during the deployment process.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     - name: Extract version
       id: version
       run: echo "VERSION=$(jq -r '.version' package.json)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
     ```
   - Embed this version into the deployment process or logs.

5. **Provide Feedback**:
   - Add success/failure notifications to improve visibility of deployment outcomes (e.g., GitHub deployment status or Slack notifications).
   
#### Benefits
- **Reliability**: Validating the build reduces the risk of deploying broken changes.
- **Automation**: Automating `package.json` versioning ensures consistency and reduces manual effort.
- **Efficiency**: Improved caching strategies speed up workflow runs.
- **Visibility**: Embedding and logging the version helps track deployed releases easily.
