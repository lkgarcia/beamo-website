### Feature Request: Add Contact Us functionality using mailto link

#### Description
Implement a simple Contact Us feature on the Beamo website using a mailto link. This feature allows users to click a link, opening their default email client to send a message to the sales distribution list (hello@beamo.ph).

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Add a visually appealing "Contact Us" link or button on the website.
- Link directly to a mailto link: `mailto:hello@beamo.ph?subject=Contact Us&body=Hi Beamo Team,%0A%0A`.
- Ensure the subject and body placeholders are pre-filled to make it easier for users to send emails.

#### Example Implementation
```html
<a href="mailto:hello@beamo.ph?subject=Contact Us&body=Hi Beamo Team,%0A%0A">Contact Us</a>
``` 

#### Additional Notes
- This solution is lightweight and does not require any backend setup.
- Ensure the style of the link blends well with the overall design of the website.
